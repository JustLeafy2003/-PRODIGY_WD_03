# PRODIGY_WD_03
Repository for the Web Developer task #3 for my internship at Prodigy Infotech: A tic-tac-toe web game, with AI and 2 player modes.

This website features three pages: the main page, and the two game modes, 2 player mode and AI mode.

On the main page, there is a simple blue header with only "Tic Tac Toe" at the center, and in the body, there is a description for tic-tac-toe and its modes in the website. Below them are the buttons leading to either mode. The description and the buttons have an animation that would make them appear.

In both modes, elements that can be commonly found include a backlink to the main page, a "Restart Game" button that is available at any time, and the tic-tac-toe cell board. Furthermore, cells, which have blue borders, blue text colors, and white background, would have their colors inverted on the winning cells, if a tic-tac-toe game ends up having a winner.

In the 2 player mode, the first player starts with X, while the second starts with O. In AI mode, the player goes against a simple/casual AI, and either one can randomly start taking turns.
